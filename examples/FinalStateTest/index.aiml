  <state id="start">

      <prompt>
        This is the start state. It should automatically transition to the final state
        because it doesn't have any explicit transitions.
      </prompt>
    </llm>
  </state>
  
  <state id="another_state">
    <llm model="accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct">
      <prompt>
        This state has an explicit transition so it should not automatically 
        transition to the final state.
      </prompt>
    </llm>
    <transition target="third_state" />
  </state>
  
  <state id="third_state">
    <llm model="accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct">
      <prompt>
        This is the third state. It's also a leaf node, so it should
        automatically transition to the final state.
      </prompt>
    </llm>
  </state>
