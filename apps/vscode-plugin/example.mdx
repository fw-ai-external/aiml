# This is a text based prompt (it is optional)

You can write a prompt just like any other prompt you might send to an LLM.
It will be executed in the context of the state. If you use it,
it will be executed before the first state, and its output passed to the first state.

<CustomState initial />

<state id="next">
    <llm 
        prompt="What is the capital of France?"

        state.set("next", "test");
    </script>
    <transition to="final" />
