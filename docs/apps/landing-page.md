- **SEO Optimization:** Includes metadata and structure to improve search engine visibility.

## Setup/Usage

This is typically a static site or built using a static site generator. Setup might involve:

```bash
bun install
bun run build
# Serve the built files (e.g., using a static server)
```

_(Note: Actual commands may vary)_

Usage involves navigating the website through a browser.

## Key Dependencies
