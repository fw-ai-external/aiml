## Overview

This application provides the user interface components and potentially the overall frontend structure for interacting with AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) functionalities. It likely allows users to view, manage, or interact with AIML agents or documents.

## Key Features/Functionality

- **Component Library:** A set of reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, forms, viewers) tailored for AIML tasks.
- **State Management:** Handles the frontend application state, possibly using libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React Context.
- **API Interaction:** Communicates with backend services (like the `server` application) to fetch data or trigger AIML operations.
- **Visualization:** May include components for visualizing AIML structures, conversation flows, or agent status.

## Setup/Usage

```bash
# Example setup (assuming a typical Bun frontend)
bun install
bun run start # Or bun run dev
```

_(Note: Actual commands may vary)_

Usage typically involves importing and composing components within the application structure.

## Key Dependencies

- **Framework:** Likely React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.
- **Styling:** CSS libraries (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI) or CSS-in-JS solutions.
- **Internal:** May depend on the `@fireworks/shared` package for common types or utilities.
- **API Client:** A library for making HTTP requests (e.g., `axios`, `fetch`).

## Architecture Notes

- **Component-Based:** Built using a standard component architecture (e.g., Atomic Design, functional components).
- **State Management Pattern:** Follows a defined pattern for managing application state (e.g., global store, context API).
- **API Layer:** May have a dedicated layer or service for handling communication with the backend.
