Monitor and debug your AI agentic workflows with built-in observability features
AIML provides built-in observability features to help you monitor and debug your AI agents. By enabling logging, you can track agent interactions, performance metrics, and costs in real-time through the developer dashboard.

​
## Getting Started

To observability is enabled by default for all agents. 

### Using IDE Plugins
<Banner className="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg">Coming soon: AIML IDE plugins for VS Code, Cursor, Vim, Emacs and more!</Banner>

### Using the developer UI

To start the developer UI locally:

1. Navigate to the aiml-ui directory:
```bash
cd apps/aiml-ui
```

2. Copy the example environment file and add your Firework API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and add your Firework API key.

3. Install dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The developer UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Logs
The developer UI provides comprehensive logging capabilities:
- Real-time log streaming for all agent interactions
- Log filtering by severity (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Search and filter logs by timestamp, agent ID, or content
- Log context expansion to see full interaction details
- Export logs for offline analysis

### Traces
Trace and analyze agent execution paths:
- Detailed execution traces showing each step
- Timing information for performance analysis
- Input/output data at each step
- Error traces with full stack information
- Trace visualization with flame graphs

### Dashboards
Monitor your agents with real-time dashboards:
- Agent performance metrics
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Response time distributions
- Error rate monitoring
- Custom metric visualization

### Workflow Visualization
Watch your agentic workflows in action:
- Interactive workflow graph visualization
- Real-time state updates
- Step-by-step execution playback
- Visual debugging tools
- State inspection at any point
- Branch and parallel execution visualization


## What’s Being recorded

When observability is enabled, AIML automatically tracks:

- Agent interactions and their outcomes
- Model usage and token consumption
- Cost metrics per interaction
- Response times and latency
- Evaluation steps and reasoning
- Step executions and their results
- Errors and failure cases
