# Tool Element

<Banner className="bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg">Coming soon: This feature is not yet available. Please check back soon.</Banner>

The `<tool>` element defines an MCP (Multi-provider Context) integration, typically representing an external service or API. It makes the capabilities of this service available to `<script>` and `<llm>` elements within the application.
```mdx
<tool 
  type="mcp"
  id="weather"
  url="https://mcp.composio.dev/weathermap/<your secure url>"
/>
```

## Props

<TypeTable type={{
    type: {
      type: '"mcp" | "function"',
      description: "Specifies the type as an MCP tool.",
      required: true
    },
    id: {
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for this tool instance. Used to access the tool in scripts (`ctx.tools[id]`) and LLMs (`tools={[id]}`).",
      required: true
    },
    url: {
      type: "string",
      description: "The URL endpoint of the external MCP server. Only required if type is `mcp`.",
      required: false
    },
    function: {
      type: "function",
      description: "The function to call when the tool is invoked. Only required if type is `function`.",
      required: false
    },
    args: {
      type: "object",
      description: "The JSONSchema of the arguments to pass to the function when the tool is invoked. Only required if type is `function`.",
      required: false
    }
  }} />

## Examples

### Basic MCP Tool

Defines a single tool for accessing a weather API.

```mdx
<tool 
  type="mcp" 
  id="weather" 
  url="https://mcp.composio.dev/weathermap/<your secure url>"
/>
```

### Multiple MCP Tools

Multiple tools can be defined within a `<datamodel>` to integrate with various services.

```mdx
<datamodel>
  <tool 
    type="mcp"
    id="weather"
    url="https://mcp.composio.dev/weathermap/<your secure url>"
  />
  
  <tool 
    type="mcp"
    id="translator"
    url="https://api.translate.example.com"
  />

  <data id="currentLocation" type="STRING" value="London" />
</datamodel>
```

## Usage Notes

- `<tool>` elements are defined within a `<datamodel>` element.
- They act as pointers to external MCP-compliant services.
- The `id` is crucial for referencing the tool elsewhere in the application.
- The `url` must point to a valid MCP server endpoint.
- See the [Using MCP Integrations guide](/docs/mcp/adding-mcp-usage) for details on how to use these tools in scripts and LLMs.
