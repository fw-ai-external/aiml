# Script Element

The `<script>` element executes JavaScript or Python code:

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="jsx" code={`<script>
  // JavaScript code here
  console.log("Executing script...");
</script>`} />

<TypeTable
  type={{
    language: {
      description: 'Language of the script',
      type: '"javascript" | "python"',
      required: false,
      default: 'javascript'
    }
  }}
/>

Of note, each script element is executed in a new context, so you don't need to worry about variable collisions. This also means that you can't define functions that are used by multiple script elements.

## Examples

### Inline Script

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="jsx" code={`<script>
  // Perform calculations
  const result = calculateTotal(items);
  console.log(\`Total: \${result}\`);
</script>`} />

### State Manipulation

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="jsx" code={`<script>
  // Update state based on calculations
  const newValue = performComplexCalculation();
  dataModel.setValue("state.result", newValue);
</script>`} />

## Usage Notes

- Use scripts for complex logic that's difficult to express with other elements
- Keep scripts focused and modular
- Consider moving complex logic to external files
- Be cautious with global state modifications
- Use appropriate error handling
