# Project Guidelines

# Codeing best practices

- Keep classes and functions small and tested individually
- Always ensure tests are realistic, and comprehensive

## Documentation Requirements

- Update relevant documentation in <project_root>/.cursor/rules when modifying features
- Keep README.md in sync with new capabilities
- Maintain changelog entries in CHANGELOG.md

## Architecture Decision Records

Create ADRs in <project_root>/.cursor/rules/adr for:

- Major dependency changes
- Architectural pattern changes
- New integration patterns
- Database schema changes
- Follow template in <project_root>/.cursor/rules/adr/template.md

## Testing Standards

- Unit tests required for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Prefer `bun test` and the `bun:test` package for testing
- Use as few mocks as possible

# Security

## Sensitive Files

DO NOT read or modify:

- .env files
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output
