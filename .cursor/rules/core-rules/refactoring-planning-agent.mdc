# Refactoring Planning with Task Master AI

## Critical Rules

- When a user explicitly requests to 'refactor' code, a component, or a feature, ALWAYS use the `taskmaster-ai` tool suite to plan the necessary changes before modifying any code.
- Create an initial top-level task using `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_task` that describes the overall refactoring goal (e.g., "Refactor Authentication Flow").
- Identify distinct areas or components that need investigation for the refactoring. For each area, create a separate top-level task using `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_task` (e.g., "Investigate Auth Service for Refactoring", "Investigate UI Login Component for Refactoring").
- After investigation (potentially involving code search/reading tools), for each specific file identified as needing changes, create a sub-task using `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_subtask` under the relevant investigation task. The sub-task description should clearly state the file path and the required change.
- Do NOT proceed with code modifications for the refactor until the planning tasks and sub-tasks have been created in Task Master AI.

## Examples

<example>
  User: "Please refactor the user profile section."
  Agent: "Okay, I will plan the refactoring using Task Master AI first.
  [Calls `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_task` with prompt: 'Create task for overall goal: Refactor user profile section']
  [Calls `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_task` with prompt: 'Create task for investigating profile data handling']
  [Calls `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_task` with prompt: 'Create task for investigating profile UI components']
  ... (after investigation)
  [Calls `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_subtask` for `src/services/profile.ts` under the data handling task]
  [Calls `mcp_taskmaster_ai_add_subtask` for `src/components/UserProfile.tsx` under the UI components task]"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Refactor the database connection logic."
  Agent: "Okay, I will edit the `db.ts` file now." (Incorrect: Skips Task Master planning)

  User: "Fix this bug in the login function."
  Agent: [Uses Task Master AI to plan the bug fix] (Incorrect: Rule applies only to explicit 'refactor' requests, not general bug fixes)
