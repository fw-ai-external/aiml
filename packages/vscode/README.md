# AIML for Visual Studio Code

## Build production-ready agents & AI workflows with nothing but prompting

The AIML VSCode extension provides a rich development experience for creating deterministic, reliable AI agents and workflows using the AIML language - a simple yet powerful combination of Markdown with XML tags.

> **Alpha Preview**: Please note that AIML is still baking and is under heavy development.

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for AIML files
- **Intelligent language server** with real-time error reporting
- **Code completion** for AIML tags and attributes
- **Debugging tools** to visualize your agent's execution
- **JSX syntax support** for a familiar developer experience

## Why AIML?

AIML allows you to easily build reliable, deterministic agents and workflows without having to learn a new framework or constantly bounce between code and natural language prompts. This enables AI experts and non-experts to collaborate more effectively.

- **No framework lock-in** - It's just Markdown with XML tags
- **Code when you want it** - Execute JavaScript or Python in secure sandboxed environments
- **State Graph based workflows** - Define complex flows with conditional branching and visualization

## Getting Started

1. Install the extension from the VSCode marketplace
2. Create a new file with the `.aiml` extension
3. Start building your AI agent with AIML syntax
4. Send your AIML file as the contents of a system message to any AIML enabled LLM API such as the ones provided by fireworks.ai
