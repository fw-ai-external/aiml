# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the AIML runtime environment project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**

- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 _most critical_ tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the _current_ state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- AIML Syntax documentation and clarification
- Refinement of the formalize.ts module in the runtime package to properly handle element hydration
- CRCT System initialization and dependency tracking
- Understanding module-level dependencies in the AIML runtime environment
- Implementation of TDD practices and build integrity requirements

## Next Steps:

1. Address streaming-related test issues in RunValue.test.ts (separate task)
2. Continue enhancing parser error handling for critical elements like LLM that require specific attributes
3. Complete Strategy phase planning for project tasks
4. Review identified dependencies for accuracy
5. Develop mini-trackers for critical packages/modules
6. Consider creating technical documentation for StepValue and RunValue APIs
7. Explore additional documentation needs for the parsing and execution flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- Separation of concerns between parser and runtime packages - how to ensure proper coordination
- How to optimally manage the circular dependencies observed between packages
- How to make tests more resilient to implementation changes
- Whether to split or consolidate any of the existing packages
- Potential optimization strategies for the element system
- Implementation of validation scripts for enforcing build and test integrity
- Balancing real implementations vs. minimal mocks in test strategies
