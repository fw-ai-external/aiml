# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the AIML runtime environment project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**

- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 _most critical_ tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the _current_ state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- CRCT System initialization and dependency tracking
- Understanding module-level dependencies in the AIML runtime environment
- Comprehensive documentation of the AIML architecture and core components

## Next Steps:

1. Complete Strategy phase planning for project tasks
2. Review identified dependencies for accuracy
3. Begin planning key enhancement tasks for the runtime environment
4. Develop mini-trackers for critical packages/modules
5. Consider creating technical documentation for StepValue and RunValue APIs
6. Explore additional documentation needs for the parsing and execution flow

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- How to optimally manage the circular dependencies observed between packages
- Whether to split or consolidate any of the existing packages
- Potential optimization strategies for the element system
