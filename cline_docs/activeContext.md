# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the AIML runtime environment project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**

- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 _most critical_ tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the _current_ state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- CRCT System re-initialization and dependency tracking
- Completion of mini-trackers for all packages
- Preparation for parser error handling enhancement
- Implementation of data and datamodel elements with type validation, document-based scoping, readonly properties, and request-based values

## Next Steps:

1. Complete the Set-up/Maintenance phase by resolving all placeholder dependencies
2. Implement parser error handling for critical elements like LLM that require specific attributes
3. Implement enhanced data and datamodel elements with type validation, document-based scoping, readonly properties, and request-based values
4. Update ElementExecutionContext to respect scope and type validations
5. Update AssignElement to check for readonly properties before updating values
6. Consider creating technical documentation for StepValue and RunValue APIs
7. Explore additional documentation needs for the parsing and execution flow
8. Move to Strategy phase for planning next development tasks

## Recent Updates:

1. Re-initialized CRCT system for setup
2. Updated dependency_tracker.md to resolve placeholder dependencies for apps
3. Generated mini-trackers for all packages (element-config, shared, types, language-server, tsconfig, vscode)
4. Fixed doc_tracker.md structure

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- Separation of concerns between parser and runtime packages - how to ensure proper coordination
- How to optimally manage the circular dependencies observed between packages
- How to make tests more resilient to implementation changes
- Whether to split or consolidate any of the existing packages
- Potential optimization strategies for the element system
- Implementation of validation scripts for enforcing build and test integrity
- Balancing real implementations vs. minimal mocks in test strategies
- Data validation strategy: how to balance type safety with flexibility in the datamodel
- Document-based scoping: ensuring proper variable access based on the hierarchical structure of states and datamodels
