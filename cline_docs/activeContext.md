# Active Context:

**Purpose:** This file provides a concise overview of the current work focus, immediate next steps, and active decisions for the AIML runtime environment project. It is intended to be a frequently referenced, high-level summary to maintain project momentum and team alignment.

**Use Guidelines:**

- **Current Work Focus:** List the 2-3 _most critical_ tasks currently being actively worked on. Keep descriptions concise and action-oriented.
- **Next Steps:** List the immediate next steps required to advance the project. Prioritize and order these steps for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations:** Document key decisions currently being considered or actively debated. Capture the essence of the decision and any open questions.
- **Do NOT include:** Detailed task breakdowns, historical changes, long-term plans (these belong in other memory bank files like `progress.md` or dedicated documentation).
- **Maintain Brevity:** Keep this file concise and focused on the _current_ state of the project. Regularly review and prune outdated information.

## Current Work Focus:

- Enhancing parser validation for assign elements with type mismatches and scope violations
- Improving element execution with better typing and error handling
- Implementing diagnostics for assigning to variables that don't exist, are readonly, or out of scope

## Next Steps:

1. Complete the Set-up/Maintenance phase by resolving all placeholder dependencies
2. Implement parser error handling for critical elements like LLM that require specific attributes
3. Enhance parser to provide diagnostic errors for assign elements with type mismatches or scope violations
4. Add validation phase to parser pipeline to check assign elements against the datamodel
5. Implement diagnostics for assigning to variables that don't exist, are readonly, or out of scope
6. Consider creating technical documentation for StepValue and RunValue APIs
7. Explore additional documentation needs for the parsing and execution flow
8. Move to Strategy phase for planning next development tasks

## Recent Updates:

1. Simplified the data model type system by consolidating complex types into a single JSON type
2. Renamed ValueType.COMPLEX to ValueType.JSON and removed redundant ValueType.OBJECT and ValueType.ARRAY
3. Updated validateValueType and getDefaultForType functions to handle JSON validation with schema requirements
4. Updated documentation in docs/data-model.md to reflect the new type system
5. Re-initialized CRCT system for setup
6. Updated dependency_tracker.md to resolve placeholder dependencies for apps
7. Generated mini-trackers for all packages (element-config, shared, types, language-server, tsconfig, vscode)
8. Fixed doc_tracker.md structure

## Active Decisions and Considerations:

- Separation of concerns between parser and runtime packages - how to ensure proper coordination
- How to optimally manage the circular dependencies observed between packages
- How to make tests more resilient to implementation changes
- Whether to split or consolidate any of the existing packages
- Potential optimization strategies for the element system
- Implementation of validation scripts for enforcing build and test integrity
- Balancing real implementations vs. minimal mocks in test strategies
- Data validation strategy: how to balance type safety with flexibility in the datamodel
- Document-based scoping: ensuring proper variable access based on the hierarchical structure of states and datamodels
- ElementExecutionContext enhancement: providing scoped datamodel with only accessible variables based on document hierarchy
- Parser validation: providing diagnostic errors for assign elements with type mismatches or scope violations
